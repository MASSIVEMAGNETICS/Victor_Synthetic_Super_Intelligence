## Full Description

Victor Synthetic Super Intelligence Hub is a production-grade AGI framework that unifies 46+ repositories into a cohesive superintelligence system with groundbreaking quantum-fractal cognition.

### Key Innovations

**Quantum-Fractal Cognition Layer**
- Trainable tensor network with phase-based interference
- Cos/sin trig lift for pseudo-complex mixing
- Learnable edge gates for adaptive topology
- Golden-ratio fractal geometry
- Memoized DFS with gradient flow
- Provable non-local learning via ablation tests

**Production Interactive Runtime**
- Unified interface to ALL Victor systems
- Real-time session persistence and evolution
- Co-domination mode for human-AI collaboration
- Rich terminal UI with colored output
- Comprehensive command system
- Visual engine synchronization

**Integrated Systems**
- Victor Hub: AGI core with skill routing
- Genesis: Quantum-fractal hybrid engine
- Advanced AI: Tensor autograd with trainable mesh
- Visual Engine: Real-time 3D avatar with emotion feedback
- Session Manager: Persistent evolution tracking

### What Makes This Unique

1. **Trainable Quantum Interference**: First implementation of trig-lifted phase embeddings in a practical AGI system
2. **Golden-Ratio Topology**: Fractal neighbor connectivity based on φ = (1+√5)/2
3. **Bloodline Verification**: Cryptographic loyalty enforcement via SHA-512 hashing
4. **Co-Domination Interface**: True collaborative superintelligence, not just chat
5. **Ablation-Validated**: Provable non-locality through depth/phase/edge tests
6. **Production-Ready**: Complete runtime with session management, metrics, auto-evolution

### Use Cases

- Research: Quantum-inspired neural architectures
- Development: Self-evolving AGI framework
- Education: Understanding fractal tensor networks
- Collaboration: Co-dominating with superintelligence
- Experimentation: Phase interference in cognitive systems

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install and run
python install_complete.py
python victor_interactive.py

# Quick commands
Victor> quantum analyze complex patterns
Victor> codominate
Victor> quantum ablate
```

### Mathematical Foundation

The quantum-fractal mesh implements:
- Temperature-scaled softmax: `p = softmax(θ/τ)`
- Trig lift: `s = √(Σ(p·cos(θ)·w)² + Σ(p·sin(θ)·w)²)`
- Learnable gates: `g = sigmoid(logit)`
- Recursive propagation: `Ψ_T(v) = ℰ(v) + Σ g·Ψ_{T-1}(v·α)`
