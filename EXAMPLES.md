## Example Session 5: Ablation Testing

```
Victor> quantum ablate
Quantum-Fractal Ablation Tests

Testing non-local learning signals:
  Depth Ablation: depth=0 → 0.123456, depth=3 → 0.847362
    Non-locality gain: 0.723906
  Phase Ablation: no-trig → 0.654321, trig-lift → 0.847362
    Interference gain: 0.193041
  Gate Ablation: disabled → 0.234567, enabled → 0.847362
    Topology gain: 0.612795

Interpretation:
  • Depth gain > 0.01: Non-locality present ✓
  • Phase gain > 0.01: Interference active ✓
  • Topology gain > 0.01: Learnable edges effective ✓
```

## Advanced: Chaining Commands

You can chain multiple operations:

```
Victor> run Analyze codebase
Victor> quantum analyze the results
Victor> reflect
Victor> session
```

## Tips & Tricks

1. **Use `menu` for quick access** to common commands
2. **Enable auto-evolution** before long sessions for continuous improvement
3. **Run ablation tests** periodically to validate learning
4. **Check `quantum report`** to track training progress
5. **Use `history`** to review previous commands
6. **Session files** are saved in `logs/sessions/` for later analysis
7. **Combine modes**: `codominate` + `evolve` for maximum collaboration
8. **Visual feedback** requires Godot project running separately

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Command not recognized
```
Victor> help
[Check spelling and available commands]
```

**Issue:** Visual not responding
```
# Ensure Godot project is running
# Check logs/sessions/ for errors
Victor> visual idle
```

**Issue:** Quantum processing seems stuck
```
Victor> quantum reset
Victor> quantum status
```

**Issue:** Want to start fresh
```
Victor> exit
# Delete logs/sessions/*.json if needed
python victor_interactive.py
```

## Next Steps

After trying these examples:
1. Explore the mathematical framework in README.md
2. Review session logs in `logs/sessions/`
3. Experiment with different quantum parameters
4. Create custom skills in `victor_hub/skills/`
5. Contribute to the project!
